1. What medical terms or phenotypes are introduced or defined in the paper?
Lupus anticoagulant (LAC), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), dilute Russell’s viper venom time (dRVVT), vitamin K antagonists (VKA), direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), factor deficiencies (e.g., factor II, factor V, factor X), false-positive LAC results, three-step interpretation, alternative interpretation.

2. What existing studies does the paper build upon or compare with?
The paper builds upon existing studies related to LAC detection, including the ISTH 2009 guidelines, CLSI guidelines, and previous research on dRVVT reagents and their sensitivity/specificity for LAC detection. It also references studies on the interference of DOACs (e.g., dabigatran, rivaroxaban) in LAC testing.

3. Which medical condition or disease is the focus of the paper?
The paper focuses on the diagnosis of lupus anticoagulant (LAC) in the context of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and the challenges associated with LAC detection, particularly in patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy.

4. What patient population is being studied?
The patient population includes 358 consecutive patients with LAC requests, 24 APS patients, 37 VKA-treated non-APS patients, and 30 DOAC-treated non-APS patients. The study also includes spiking experiments with pooled normal plasma and factor-deficient plasma.

5. What are the key findings of the paper?
Key findings include: (1) Differences in LAC detection between Stago and Haematex dRVVT reagents, with Stago showing higher sensitivity but more false positives in VKA- and DOAC-treated patients. (2) Haematex reagents are less prone to VKA-related factor deficiencies but have reduced sensitivity for APS patients. (3) DOACs (e.g., rivaroxaban, dabigatran) can cause false-positive LAC results, with Haematex showing fewer false positives compared to Stago. (4) The alternative interpretation method increased LAC positivity rates, especially in DOAC-treated patients.

6. What clinical implications are suggested by the results?
The clinical implications suggest that dRVVT reagents from different manufacturers are not equivalent and may lead to differing LAC conclusions. Laboratories should carefully evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of dRVVT reagents, especially in anticoagulated patients. Postponing LAC testing until after discontinuation of DOACs may reduce false positives.

7. What limitations or challenges are acknowledged in the study?
Limitations include the study’s focus on only two dRVVT reagents, which may not fully represent the variability among all available reagents. The lack of a gold standard for LAC testing also complicates the interpretation of true LAC positivity. Additionally, the study acknowledges the need for further investigation into the phospholipid composition of dRVVT reagents and its impact on LAC detection.
