1. What medical terms or phenotypes are introduced or defined in the paper?
Poor R-wave progression (PRWP), sudden cardiac death (SCD), coronary artery disease (CAD), cardiac death, all-cause mortality, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left anterior hemiblock (LAHB), QRS transition, delayed QRS transition, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

2. What existing studies does the paper build upon or compare with?
The paper builds upon studies such as the Finnish Health 2000 general population cohort, which examined the prevalence and prognosis of PRWP, and other studies that have associated multiple electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns with SCD risk in general populations and patient populations with cardiac disorders.

3. Which medical condition or disease is the focus of the paper?
The focus of the paper is on the prognostic significance of poor R-wave progression (PRWP) in terms of sudden cardiac death (SCD), cardiac death, and all-cause mortality in the general population and subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD).

4. What patient population is being studied?
The patient population studied consists of 6854 subjects from a Finnish general population health examination survey conducted during 1978–1980, with follow-up until 2011.

5. What are the key findings of the paper?
The key findings of the paper are that PRWP is associated with adverse prognosis in the general population, including increased risks of SCD, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality. The risk of SCD is particularly pronounced in subjects with established CAD. PRWP was also associated with older age, higher prevalence of heart failure and CAD, and b-blocker medication.

6. What clinical implications are suggested by the results?
The clinical implications suggested by the results are that diagnostic measures regarding underlying CAD in subjects with PRWP may be warranted, and PRWP could be useful in SCD risk stratification in specific patient populations, though further studies are needed.

7. What limitations or challenges are acknowledged in the study?
Limitations acknowledged in the study include the relatively small number of SCD end points, particularly in subjects without CAD, leading to wide confidence intervals and uncertain statistical inference. Additionally, no echocardiography was performed, so data on cardiac structure or left ventricular function were unavailable. The study setup does not allow determination of how many patients with PRWP were referred for medical assistance, and the baseline examinations were performed in 1978–1980, which may differ from today's populations.
