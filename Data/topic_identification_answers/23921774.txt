1. What medical terms or phenotypes are introduced or defined in the paper?
Isolated myocardial noncompaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM), right ventricular noncompaction (RV-NCCM), left ventricular noncompaction (LV-NCCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), hypertrabeculation, intertrabecular recesses, compact myocardium, fatty infiltrative ARVC, and sudden unexpected death.

2. What existing studies does the paper build upon or compare with?
The paper builds upon studies by Gomathi et al. (2008), Li et al. (2010), Ichida (2009), Burke et al. (2005), Minardi et al. (2010), Ulosoy et al. (2006), Engberding et al. (2010), Sarma et al. (2010), Zhang et al. (2009), Song (2008), Fazio et al. (2010), Song (2011), Roberts et al. (2010), Dâ€™Amati et al. (2001), Wozniak et al. (2008), and Matsukuma et al. (2010).

3. Which medical condition or disease is the focus of the paper?
The focus of the paper is isolated right ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (RV-NCCM) and its association with sudden death.

4. What patient population is being studied?
The patient population studied consists of two adult cases of sudden unexpected death, specifically a 46-year-old white woman and a 52-year-old white woman.

5. What are the key findings of the paper?
The key findings include the presence of unexplained right ventricular dilation and prominent apical hypertrabeculation in both cases, pathological similarities between RV-NCCM and ARVC, and the coexistence of biventricular involvement, right ventricle fatty infiltration, and attenuation of the compact wall in areas of noncompaction.

6. What clinical implications are suggested by the results?
The clinical implications suggest that cases of sudden cardiac death with insignificant coronary disease and unexplained right ventricular dilation should warrant suspicion of a cardiomyopathy, particularly if right apical hypertrabeculation, compact wall attenuation, and/or deep intertrabecular recesses are present.

7. What limitations or challenges are acknowledged in the study?
The limitations acknowledged include the lack of well-defined anatomic criteria for diagnosing RV-NCCM, the difficulty in distinguishing between noncompaction and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies at autopsy, and the need for further investigations to establish diagnostic criteria and determine whether isolated right ventricle hypertrabeculation exists as a cause of sudden unexpected death independent of ARVC or LV-NCCM.
