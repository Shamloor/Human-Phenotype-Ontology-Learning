1. What medical terms or phenotypes are introduced or defined in the paper?
Neural tube defects (NTDs), craniorachischisis (CRN), spina bifida, anencephaly, primary neurulation, Closure 1, Closure 2, neural tube closure, planar cell polarity (PCP), convergent extension cell movements.

2. What existing studies does the paper build upon or compare with?
The paper builds upon previous studies of mouse models with mutations in core members of the planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling pathway, such as Vangl2, Celsr1, Dsh1/2, Scrib, Fz3/6, Ptk7, and Sec2b. It also references studies on the genetic basis of neural tube defects (NTDs) and the role of PCP genes in neural tube closure.

3. Which medical condition or disease is the focus of the paper?
The focus of the paper is the severe neural tube defect known as craniorachischisis (CRN).

4. What patient population is being studied?
The patient population studied consists of 36 fetuses with craniorachischisis (CRN), collected from various medical centers.

5. What are the key findings of the paper?
The key findings of the paper are the identification of eight potentially causative mutations in the PCP genes CELSR1 and SCRIB in patients with craniorachischisis (CRN). These mutations were found to affect subcellular protein localisation, particularly trafficking to the plasma membrane, which is likely a pathogenic mechanism for CRN.

6. What clinical implications are suggested by the results?
The clinical implications suggest that mutations in CELSR1 and SCRIB may represent a cause of craniorachischisis in humans, similar to findings in mouse models. This could lead to better genetic screening and understanding of the disease mechanism.

7. What limitations or challenges are acknowledged in the study?
The limitations or challenges acknowledged in the study include the complex inheritance pattern of NTDs, the potential contribution of non-genetic factors, and the need for further research to confirm the role of these mutations in CRN. The study also notes the possibility of reduced penetrance for some mutations and the influence of genetic background or environmental factors.
