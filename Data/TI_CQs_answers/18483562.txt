1. What medical terms or phenotypes are introduced or defined in the paper?
Triangular nuclear cataract, consanguineous family, congenital cataracts, recessive mode of inheritance, frame shift mutation, GJA8 gene, connexin50, heterozygous, homozygous, variable expressivity, weak phenotype, metabolic disorders, hyperferritinemia, autosomal recessive cataract, autosomal dominant cataract, nonsense-mediated decay, COOH-terminal domain, transmembrane domains, extracellular loops, neurologic disorders, psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia.

2. What existing studies does the paper build upon or compare with?
The paper builds upon studies of congenital cataracts, including mutations in genes coding for γ-crystallins, α- and β-crystallins, MIP/Mip, GJA3/Gja3, and GJA8/Gja8. It references studies on recessive mutations in BFSP1, CRYAA, CRYBB1, CRYBB3, GJA8, GCNT2, HSF4, and LIM2. It also compares with studies on dominant GJA8 mutations such as Arg23Thr, Val44Glu, Trp45Ser, Asp47Asn, Glu48Lys, Val79Leu, Pro88Ser, Pro88Qln, Pro189Leu, Arg198Glu, and Ser276Phe.

3. Which medical condition or disease is the focus of the paper?
The focus of the paper is a novel GJA8 mutation causing a recessive triangular cataract.

4. What patient population is being studied?
The patient population being studied is a consanguineous family from central Turkey with congenital cataracts, specifically the proband and her family members.

5. What are the key findings of the paper?
The key findings of the paper are the identification of a homozygous insertion of one G after position 776 of the GJA8 gene (c776insG) in the proband and her brother, leading to a frame shift and 123 novel amino acids. This mutation causes a recessive triangular cataract with variable expressivity in heterozygotes. The mutation was not found in 96 healthy controls.

6. What clinical implications are suggested by the results?
The clinical implications suggest that the ins776G mutation in the GJA8 gene is most likely causative for a recessive triangular cataract. The study highlights the importance of genetic analysis in understanding the etiology of congenital cataracts, especially in consanguineous families.

7. What limitations or challenges are acknowledged in the study?
The limitations acknowledged in the study include the small size of the family, which did not allow for genome-wide mapping, and the open question of whether the slight opacities observed in the mother and grandmother are associated with the GJA8 mutation. The study also notes the possibility of sex-linked expressivity or polymorphisms in other genes as contributing factors.
