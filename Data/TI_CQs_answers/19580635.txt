1. What medical terms or phenotypes are introduced or defined in the paper?
Hyperbiliverdinaemia, green jaundice, biliverdin reductase-A (BVR-A) gene mutation, liver cirrhosis, biliverdin, bilirubin, haeme oxygenase (HO), porto-systemic shunting, decompensated liver cirrhosis.

2. What existing studies does the paper build upon or compare with?
The paper builds upon previous studies on hyperbiliverdinaemia, biliverdin reductase activity, and liver cirrhosis. It references studies on bilirubin kinetics, green jaundice, biliverdin reductase isoforms, and genetic defects in the haeme degradation pathway, such as the case of HO-1 mutation in a child.

3. Which medical condition or disease is the focus of the paper?
The focus of the paper is hyperbiliverdinaemia (green jaundice) caused by a novel mutation in the biliverdin reductase-A (BVR-A) gene in conjunction with decompensated liver cirrhosis.

4. What patient population is being studied?
The patient population studied includes a 64-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis, his relatives (two children and one sister), 200 healthy volunteers, and nine patients with end-stage liver cirrhosis.

5. What are the key findings of the paper?
The key findings include the identification of a novel heterozygous C → T nonsense mutation in the BVR-A gene (R18Stop) in the proband, which truncates the protein N-terminally to the active site. This mutation, combined with decompensated liver cirrhosis, led to hyperbiliverdinaemia. The mutation was not found in healthy controls or other cirrhosis patients. The proband’s children were heterozygous for the mutation but showed no clinical signs of liver disease or elevated biliverdin levels.

6. What clinical implications are suggested by the results?
The clinical implications suggest that hyperbiliverdinaemia (green jaundice) can result from a genetic defect in the BVR-A gene combined with liver cirrhosis. This condition may signal insufficient haeme degradation and impaired liver function. The findings highlight the role of BVR-A in biliverdin metabolism and its potential impact in liver disease.

7. What limitations or challenges are acknowledged in the study?
Limitations include the inability to measure BVR activity in the proband’s children due to their refusal for further blood testing. Additionally, the study could not assess whether the other allele of the BVR-A gene was mutated outside the coding region or if BVR-A activity was regulated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation due to inadequate postmortem samples. The low prevalence of the mutation in the general population also limits broader conclusions.
