1. What medical terms or phenotypes are introduced or defined in the paper?
Lateral medullary syndrome (LMS), Wallenbergâ€™s syndrome, paroxysmal sneezing, vertebral artery dissection, sneeze center, medullary ischemia, dysmetria, truncal ataxia, ptosis, miosis, nystagmus, dysphagia, hiccups.

2. What existing studies does the paper build upon or compare with?
The paper builds upon studies by Schievink (2001), Bernat and Suranyi (2000), Nonaka et al. (1990), Seijo-Martinez et al. (2006), Park et al. (2005), Prosiegel et al. (2005), Ropper (1988), and Frisoni and Anzola (1991).

3. Which medical condition or disease is the focus of the paper?
The focus of the paper is lateral medullary syndrome (LMS) and its association with paroxysmal sneezing.

4. What patient population is being studied?
The patient population studied includes an 82-year-old man and a 54-year-old man, both with hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors.

5. What are the key findings of the paper?
The key findings are that paroxysmal sneezing can be an initial symptom of lateral medullary ischemia rather than a cause of vertebral artery dissection, and that sneezing at the onset of LMS does not necessarily imply an underlying dissection.

6. What clinical implications are suggested by the results?
The clinical implications suggest that paroxysmal sneezing at the onset of LMS should be considered a potential symptom of medullary ischemia rather than a precipitating cause, which may influence diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

7. What limitations or challenges are acknowledged in the study?
The limitations include the small sample size (only two cases), the inability to perform MRI in one case due to metal in the orbit, and the inconclusive findings in the second case regarding vertebral artery dissection or atherosclerosis.
